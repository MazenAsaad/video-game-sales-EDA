# Exploratory Data Analysis of Video Game Sales
This repository contains the data and Jupyter notebook for a side-project I did in late 2018 to practice my python and data science skills. In it, I walk through the cleaning and exploration of a Kaggle dataset containing sales records and metadata from thousands of different video games (https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). I also perform some statistical analysis (regression & bootstrapping) to determine whether Sony or Microsoft has performed better in the last 3 console generations.
